Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- write a query to get region wise count of return orders
select region,count(distinct o.order_id) as no_of_return_orders
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by region

2- write a query to get category wise sales of orders that were not returned
select category,sum(o.sales) as total_sales
from orders o
left join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
where r.order_id is null
group by category


3- write a query to print dep name and average salary of employees in that dep .
select d.dep_name,avg(e.salary) as avg_sal
from employee e
inner join dept d on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name

4- write a query to print dep names where none of the emplyees have same salary.
select d.dep_name
from employee e
inner join dept d on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name
having count(e.emp_id)=count(distinct e.salary)

5- write a query to print sub categories where we have all 3 kinds of returns (others,bad quality,wrong items)
select o.sub_category
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by o.sub_category
having count(distinct r.return_reason)=3

6- write a query to find cities where not even a single order was returned.
select city
from orders o
left join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by city
having count(r.order_id)=0

7- write a query to find top 3 subcategories by sales of returned orders in east region
select top 3 sub_category,sum(o.sales) as return_sales
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
where o.region='East'
group by sub_category
order by return_sales  desc

8- write a query to print dep name for which there is no employee
select d.dep_id,d.dep_name
from dept d 
left join employee e on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
where e.dept_id is null

9- write a query to print employees name for which dep id is not avaiable in dept table
select e.*
from employee e 
left join dept d  on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
where d.dep_id is null;


10-write a query to print emp name , their manager name and diffrence in their age for employees whose age is less then their manager's age 

select e1.emp_name,e2.emp_name as manager_name ,  e2.emp_age-e1.emp_age  as diff_in_age
from employee e1
inner join employee e2 on e1.manager_id=e2.emp_id
where e1.emp_age<e2.emp_age 

11-write a query to print emp name, manager name and senior manager name (senior manager is manager's manager)

select e1.emp_name,e2.emp_name as manager_name,e3.emp_name as senior_manager_name
from employee e1
inner join employee e2 on e1.manager_id=e2.emp_id
inner join employee e3 on e2.manager_id=e3.emp_id
